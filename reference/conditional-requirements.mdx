## Validation Logic

Conditional requirements are evaluated using this logic:

```
IF condition_field = trigger_value THEN
  required_field MUST NOT be empty
```

Example:
```
IF CHILD_WELFARE_INVOLVEMENT = '1' THEN
  TRAILS_IDENTIFIER MUST NOT be empty
```

## Error Messages

Conditional requirement violations produce errors like:

```
XFD-001: {required_field} required when {condition_field} = {trigger_value}
```

Example:
```
XFD-001: TRAILS_IDENTIFIER required when CHILD_WELFARE_INVOLVEMENT = 1
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Check Conditions First" icon="check">
    Before submitting, verify which conditional fields apply to your records
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Templates" icon="file">
    Templates include all fields - conditionally required fields clearly marked
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validate Before Submit" icon="shield-check">
    Run validation to catch missing conditional fields
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Decisions" icon="clipboard">
    When a conditional field doesn't apply, leave it empty (don't use placeholders)
