## Overview

Race and ethnicity are captured in separate fields following federal reporting standards. Race is a multi-value field (clients may identify with multiple races), while ethnicity is a single value.

## Race Codes

The `RACE` field accepts multiple values separated by `; ` (semicolon and space).

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01` | Alaska Native |
| `02` | American Indian |
| `03` | Asian |
| `04` | Black or African American |
| `05` | Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander |
| `06` | White |
| `07` | Some Other Race |
| `97` | Don't Know |
| `98` | Refused |
| `99` | Not Collected |

### Multi-Race Examples

```csv
# Single race
RACE
06

# Multiple races (Black and White)
RACE
04; 06

# Multiple races (American Indian, White, and Other)
RACE
02; 06; 07
```

## Ethnicity Codes

The `ETHNICITY` field accepts a single value.

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1` | Hispanic or Latino |
| `2` | Not Hispanic or Latino |
| `7` | Don't Know |
| `8` | Refused |
| `9` | Not Collected |

### Ethnicity Examples

```csv
# Hispanic
ETHNICITY
1

# Not Hispanic
ETHNICITY
2
```

## Federal Reporting Alignment

These codes align with:
- OMB Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 (Race and Ethnicity Standards)
- SAMHSA TEDS (Treatment Episode Data Set) requirements
- CMS reporting standards

## Usage Notes

<Note>
Race and ethnicity are separate concepts. A client who identifies as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race.
</Note>

### Best Practices

1. **Ask about ethnicity first** - This allows respondents to self-identify as Hispanic/Latino before selecting race
2. **Allow multiple race selections** - Do not force single-race selection
3. **Use "Refused" appropriately** - When client explicitly declines to answer
4. **Use "Don't Know" sparingly** - When client genuinely does not know
5. **Avoid "Not Collected"** - Make every effort to collect this information
