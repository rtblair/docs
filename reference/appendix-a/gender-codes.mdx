## Collection Guidelines

<Tip>
These fields should be self-reported by the client. Do not make assumptions based on appearance or other characteristics.
</Tip>

### Best Practices

1. **Ensure privacy** - Collect in private setting
2. **Use client's terminology** - Record what client reports
3. **Explain purpose** - Help clients understand why data is collected
4. **Respect refusals** - Use code `98` when client declines
5. **Offer "Questioning"** - For clients exploring their identity

### Special Populations

- For minors, follow guardian consent requirements
- For clients with cognitive impairments, document capacity to self-report
