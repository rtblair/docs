## Employment as Outcome

Compare `EMPLOYMENT_STATUS` between admission and discharge to measure employment outcomes:

```csv
# Admission - Unemployed
RECORD_TYPE,EMPLOYMENT_STATUS
ADM,03

# Discharge - Part-time employed
RECORD_TYPE,EMPLOYMENT_STATUS
DIS,02
```

### Positive Outcome Categories

Transitions to any of these codes typically represent improved functioning:
- `01` Full-Time
- `02` Part-Time
- `06` Retired (age-appropriate)
- `07`, `08` Student
- `14` Supported Employment

<Tip>
For clients with disabilities, `14` (Supported Employment) or `15` (Sheltered Workshop) may represent excellent outcomes.

| 18-65 | 01-05, 07-09, 14-16 |

| `10` or `11` (Military) | `VETERAN_STATUS` = `0` (active) |
